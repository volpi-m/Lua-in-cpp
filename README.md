# Lua in C++

## An encapsulation of Lua's API in C++.

This repository is very much work in progress, it is currently being reworked. However, you can find classes to use Lua's API in C++ and use it to script things into your C++ programs.

This has been tested with C++ 20 on g++, Lua 5.4 and Ubuntu 21.10.

## How to use

Not there yet

## What is currently being done ?

Now you can load a lua file in C++ and call a function inside that file which has no parameter and no return values. Many more things are coming such as:

* Injecting values, functions and tables in a lua instance
* Call thoses functions in lua
* Call lua functions that can take parameter and return values

## A problem ? An idea ?

Please open an issue and we can discuss it :)

## Known issues

Not for now
